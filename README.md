# Usage
When you first open the site, you'll see a prompt to add your name. Go ahead and enter it in the provided text box and hit save.
This will close the modal and drop you into the main interface, where you can choose to grab some coffee with a coworker, or set up a group to go to lunch with.
Remember, you'll only be paired with a coffee buddy once, but lunch groups are unlimited.
